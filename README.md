# Machine_Learning_1_and_2
Student name: Nam Hoang

ID: 370134

This repository contains materials for a joint ML1 and ML2 project. Both inputs and outputs are used for the purpose of those 2 projects.

In order to execute the project, make sure all the zip files are decompressed and saved in the same locale.

# Description of files:
- Nam Hoang - 370134.ipynb: the code is used to generate probability of default prediction for machine learning models within the scope of this project (in Jupyter notebook format)
- dcr.rar: the dataset.
- models_hyperparameters.rar: all the tunned hyperparameters of machine learning models. You can load these hyperparameters instead of running calibration process which takes MORE THAN A DAY to complete.
- out_sample_df.rar: this file contains out-of-sample fitted values, out-of-sample fitted probability as well as out-of-sample actual observations. You can opt for loading this file in case you decide to skip the part where out-of-sample prediction is performed as this part can take up to several hours of running.

# NOTES:
- If you decide to execute the code as a whole, it will take up to 2 days or more. However, we can take a shortcut by loading files from models_hyperparameters.rar and out_sample_df.rar.
- There are skippable parts in the code, user needs to read the comments carefully before deciding whether to run these parts of the code. Most of the time, these parts are related to the generation of outputs of models_hyperparameters.rar and out_sample_df.rar.
